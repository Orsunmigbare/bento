# How to use Bento
Bento is, well, the only toolbox you will need when working with frontend!

## What is Bento?
Bento is a toolbox containing styled components such as inputfields, buttons, icons layouts and much more.

## How to use Bento?
Each component has documentation on how to use it with code examples, and information that is nice to know. However, in order to keep Bento up to date we all have a responsibility to adjust and add new components to the Bento library.

If there is documentation that is unclear or does not make any sense, do fix it or ask some of your teammembers to help you make it understandable for all. Remember taht we document all our source code in the English language to increase the readability for all members of the team.

For example, if you come across two components almost looking the same and does almost the same, you should seek to generalise those two components into one. Then you can use for example props to customize the component to do the same job. That way, Bento will have components
that is specific for its purpose, and we can focus on improving components rather than rewriting common patterns.

## How to create a story for a component
In the root of this repository, there is a folder called `.storybook`, and inside that folder you can find the file called `template.stories.mdx`.

That file is a template for you to use when creating new stories in Bento. Good luck!
