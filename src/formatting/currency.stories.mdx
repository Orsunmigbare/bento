# formatCurrency
FormatCurrency is a bento tool to help us easily format a number into currency, either by adding thousand seperators,
or by adding symbols such as $ or "kr".

### Import
All exports under formatting is imported via formatting. to use a spesific formatter you would
use ```formatting.FormatterYouWant```


```javascript
import { formatting } from "@staccx/bento"
```
usage
```javascript
formatting.formatCurrency
```

## Standard formatCurrency
This is the standard formatCurrency with no options, as standard, formatCurrency adds a space as thousand separator

## Thousand Separator
with the option prop that can be passed to formatCurrency, we can do things like change the thousand separator from
space to a dot, or whatever you want.

  <Story name="Thousand Separator">
   <CurrencyText>{formatCurrency(1000, {thousand: "."})}</CurrencyText>
  </Story>

## Currency symbol
passing symbol, and the symbol of your choice to the function, lets you tack on a symbol at the end of the number

<Preview>
  <Story name="Currency symbol">
   <CurrencyText>{formatCurrency(1000, {symbol: "$"})}</CurrencyText>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Formatting
when passing format, you are also able to do more custom formatting of the currencyString.
This example passes a symbol: "$", and formats it so that the dollar sign is at the front.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Formatting">
   <CurrencyText>{formatCurrency(1000, { symbol: "$", format: "$s  $v" })}</CurrencyText>
  </Story>
